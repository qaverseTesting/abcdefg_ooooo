# MentalHappy – Playwright Test Automation Framework  
### *End-to-End Web Automation using Playwright & TypeScript*

---

## Overview

This project is an **end-to-end test automation framework** built to validate critical **user onboarding, authentication, group access, and dashboard flows** for the MentalHappy web platform.

The framework focuses on **UI automation**, ensuring a smooth and secure experience across **signup, login, OTP verification, group joining, and session access journeys**.  
It is designed to be **scalable, maintainable, and CI/CD-ready**, following modern automation best practices.

## Key Objectives

- Validate user authentication and onboarding flows  
- Ensure group join and access control behavior  
- Verify dashboard visibility and navigation  
- Support smoke and regression test execution  
- Enable fast feedback for staging and CI pipelines

## Test Coverage (High Level)

- Authentication (Login, OTP, session handling)
- Group join and access eligibility
- Dashboard access and navigation
- Role-based user validations
- Smoke and regression scenarios
